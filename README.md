# Stereo Matching Using Minimum Spanning Tree - About Project

This project is about implement of stereo matching by minimum spanning tree (MST). And this project is one part of my graduation project.

The language what this project uses is C++.

I can't use *LaTex* to write some fumulas in *Github*, so I put some notes in *[Youdao Note](http://note.youdao.com/noteshare?id=4999a00f3ce88583c92f20bfb19a3981)*. Here are links of them:
