# Stereo Matching Using Minimum Spanning Tree

This project is about implement of stereo matching by minimum spanning tree (MST). Simultaneously, this project is one part of my graduation project.

The language the project uses is C++.

I can't use *LaTex* to write fumulas in *Github*, so I put some notes in my *[Youdao Note](http://note.youdao.com/noteshare?id=4999a00f3ce88583c92f20bfb19a3981)*. Here are links and abstracts of them:

During this project, I was reading a lot of papers about related domains and watching some documents in the Internet. Thanks a lot for these documents. And here are the links or references of them:
